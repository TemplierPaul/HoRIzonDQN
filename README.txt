Based on https://github.com/MorvanZhou/PyTorch-Tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-contents/405_DQN_Reinforcement_learning.py

While Yiming worked on the implementation of the DQN and Double DQN, I focused on taking into account the temporality of the problem with DRQN (DQN with Recurrent Neural Networks) and with the addition of Convolutional Neural Networks on multiple time steps.
